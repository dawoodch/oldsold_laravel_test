// LOOP TYPES

1	while loop
Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is true.
It tests the condition before executing the loop body.

2	for loop
Execute a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.

3	do...while loop
Like a ‘while’ statement, except that it tests the condition at the end of the loop body.

4	nested loops
You can use one or more loop inside any another ‘while’, ‘for’ or ‘do..while’ loop.



// LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS


1	break statement
Terminates the loop or switch statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop or switch.

2	continue statement
Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.

3	goto statement
Transfers control to the labeled statement. Though it is not advised to use goto statement in your program.
